# Third-Party Notices

This file is the generated inventory of third-party components distributed with
WasmTeX. The code authored in this repository is MIT-licensed (see `LICENSE`).
The release artifacts are an *aggregate distribution of TeX Live programs*
compiled to WebAssembly, each carried under its own free license; WasmTeX adds no
wrapper license over them. Their sources are the pinned TeX Live snapshot plus
the patches and scripts in this repository, which satisfies the
source-availability obligations of the GPL-licensed members of that aggregate
and preserves the separate-program boundary for host applications.

This inventory is populated as components are vendored. **As of the TL-2026
rebase (M2 item 3), no third-party code is vendored verbatim into any SHIPPED
path of this repository (the two verbatim LPPL class files described under
"Conformance test fixtures" below live only under `conformance/` — they are
test input, never shipped in the npm package or the release asset archives):
the busytex build machinery was dissolved from its M0 staging area
into `build/engines/` as our own maintained, MIT-licensed build config, each
file carrying a derived-work or original-work provenance header (below). The
TeX Live programs and packages and the fetched build dependencies are pinned by
hash but not vendored (see `build/sources/pins.lock`). The per-package license
enumeration of the SHIPPED bundles is now complete (M5 item 2 — see "TeX Live
programs, macro and font packages" below and the generated `dist/licenses.json`).
The license audit verifies the per-file provenance headers AND, fail-closed, that
every shipped TeX Live package is free; it is enforced in CI by
`build/audit/license-audit.sh` (and the container dist-stage gate).**

## Upstream: busytex/busytex (MIT)

WasmTeX's build machinery derives from **busytex/busytex** — the upstream project
that established the multicall WASM TeX binary and its Emscripten build approach
(DESIGN.md §2).

- Upstream: <https://github.com/busytex/busytex>
- Pinned commit: `f2bd7b11ee1b7b093638321c1f3e5d70389d307b`
  (recorded in `build/sources/pins.lock` `[busytex]`; `fetch.sh` hard-verifies
  `git rev-parse HEAD` against it before anything is used)
- License: **MIT**. The upstream repository has **no top-level LICENSE file**;
  its README "License" section is the license statement of record:

  > MIT - applies only to the code and scripts in the repo, not to the published
  > binaries (on the releases page). The binaries include linked TexLive code, so
  > the respective TexLived/dependencies licenses apply.

  (busytex/busytex `README.md`, "License" section, at the pinned commit.)

**Build config derived from busytex (per-file derivation headers).** At M2 item
3 the M0 staging area `build/upstream/busytex/` (which had held the machinery
vendored unmodified) was dissolved into `build/engines/` as WasmTeX's own
maintained build config. The **per-file headers are now the provenance record**
(there is no `PROVENANCE.md` manifest anymore); `build/audit/license-audit.sh`
checks (a/b) enforce that every file under `build/engines/` carries a derived-
from-busytex header naming the pinned commit, or an original-work header:

- `Makefile` — derived; our engine build config (LuaTeX, bench/native-fat,
  Ubuntu-bundle, `example`, and Cosmopolitan paths dropped; the format set
  trimmed to the non-lua retained set);
- `busytex.c` — derived; the multicall dispatcher (lua applet entries dropped);
- `emcc_wrapper.py` — derived; the `CCSKIP_*_wasm` compiler-wrapper shim, body
  unmodified;
- `README.md` — original WasmTeX work describing this directory.

The upstream helpers that only served dropped paths are **no longer forked**:
`packfs.c` / `packfs.py` (the bench native-fat binary), `cosmo_getpass.h`
(Cosmopolitan-only, a no-op on our targets), and `ubuntu_package_preload.py`
(the Ubuntu `.deb` bundle path).

**Worker/pipeline glue no longer distributed.** The `busytex_pipeline.js` /
`busytex_worker.js` glue that M0 shipped in `dist/` for faithful parity was
**dropped from `dist/` at M2 item 3**: the WasmTeX runtime replaced its role at
M1 (the demo drives our typed worker, not the glue), and M2 makes the build
config ours, so `dist/` now carries only WasmTeX-authored/-consumed artifacts.
The runtime worker sources cite the glue as a behavioural reference (MIT) in
comments; the pinned upstream commit remains fetchable via
`build/sources/pins.lock` `[busytex]` for anyone auditing that lineage.

Upstream attribution is preserved here and in `LICENSE`/`NOTICE`.

## TeX Live programs, macro and font packages

**Enumerated (M5 item 2; the prior "to be inventoried" deferral is retired).**
The tiered bundles now exist, so the license of every TeX Live package that
actually ships a file in them is inventoried and audited, not deferred. The
shipped aggregate is two disjoint bundles — `core` (always preloaded) and
`academic` (on-demand) — carrying **2 545 shipped packages** (151 in `core`,
2 394 in `academic`). A package is *shipped* iff it contributes ≥ 1 runtime file
to a bundle; Collections/Schemes (pure dependency nodes) and doc-/binary-only
packages ship nothing and carry no obligation here.

`build/bundles/licenses.mjs` reads each shipped package's `catalogue-license`
from the pinned `texlive.tlpdb`, emits the full machine-readable inventory to
**`dist/licenses.json`** (per-tier `package → license`, and an aggregate
`license → packages`; carried in the release archive and integrity-listed in
`manifest.json` with role `license-inventory`), and runs a **fail-closed audit**:
a shipped package whose license is missing / `noinfo` / `nonfree` / not on the
free allowlist FAILS the build unless it is resolved by a cited entry in
`build/bundles/license-exceptions.mjs`. The allowlist is the TeX Catalogue's
*free* license vocabulary; `catalogue-license` values are space-separated
license *lists* (a package aggregating parts under several licenses, e.g.
`ofl lppl`), and **every** token must be free.

**Distinct free licenses present** in `core` + `academic` (grouped by family; a
package with a multi-license value is counted under each token, so family counts
overlap — the exact per-package truth is `dist/licenses.json`). 36 distinct
license tokens / 82 distinct raw values in total:

| License family | Packages | Representative packages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **LPPL** (LaTeX Project Public License, all versions) | ~2 020 | `latex`, `amsmath`, `hyperref`, `siunitx` |
| **GPL / LGPL / AGPL / FDL** (GNU; incl. `agpl3` ×16, `fdl` ×6) | ~250 | `dvipdfmx`, `pgf`/`tikz` (fdl), `beamer` (fdl) |
| **MIT / X11** | ~110 | `hyph-utf8`, `lua-alt-getopt` (mit); `xetex` (x11) |
| **BSD** (bsd/bsd2/bsd3) | ~25 | `minted`, `graphicscache`, `mathfam256` |
| **Apache-2.0** | ~12 | `xetexfontinfo`, `easy-todo`, `emo` |
| **Artistic / ISC / Zlib** | ~4 | `uwmslide` (artistic), `lucide-icons` (isc) |
| **OFL / GUST font (`gfl`,`gfsl`) / Knuth** | ~24 | `amsfonts`,`fontawesome5` (ofl); `lm`,`tex-gyre` (gfl); `cm`,`bibtex`,`knuth-lib` (knuth) |
| **Public domain** (`pd`, `cc0`) | ~72 | `mfware`, `modes`, `graphics-cfg` |
| **Creative Commons** (`cc-by-*`, `cc-by-sa-*`) | ~42 | `beamerdarkthemes`, `zbmath-review-template` |
| **`other-free`** (Catalogue "free under some other license") | 85 | 63 catalogue-declared + 22 catalogue-gap resolutions (below) |

No shipped package carries a non-free (`nonfree`/`nosource`/CC-NC/CC-ND) token —
the audit's core invariant, enforced in CI (`build/audit/license-audit.sh` check
(f), and the container dist-stage gate).

**Catalogue-gap packages resolved via `LICENSE.TL` (22).** The TeX Catalogue
only catalogues user-facing macro/font packages, so a handful of shipped
TeX-Live-*proper* support packages carry no usable `catalogue-license` (17 have
none; 5 carry the non-specific `collection` bundle-token). Their freeness is
established authoritatively by TeX Live's own `LICENSE.TL` — *"all software in
the TeX Live distribution is freely redistributable … within the FSF's
definition and the DFSG"*, excepting only the separable CTAN snapshot we do not
install — so each is recorded as `other-free` with that citation in
`build/bundles/license-exceptions.mjs` (per-package rationale there):

- **`core`** (TeX Live infrastructure / base support): `glyphlist`,
  `hyphen-base`, `hyphen-english`, `latexconfig`, `texlive-msg-translations`,
  `texlive-scripts`, `texlive-scripts-extra`, `texlive.infra`, `tlshell`,
  `xetexconfig`; and the `collection`-token bundle `ltxmisc`.
- **`academic`** (CJK/Thai encodings + fonts, Chinese hyphenation, TTF utils):
  `c90`, `dnp`, `garuda-c90`, `hyphen-chinese`, `norasi-c90`, `pdfwin`,
  `ttfutils`; and the `collection`-token bundles `frankenstein`, `preprint`,
  `was`, `fragments`.

These are the packages a human reviewed; the audit stays fail-closed for any
*new* gap a future TeX Live pin introduces (until reviewed and added).

**Sources pinned, not vendored.** No TeX Live program or package source is
*vendored into this repository*. The engine sources (`texlive-source`, tag
`texlive-2026.0`, since the M2 rebase) and the texmf tree (the frozen
`texlive2026-20260301.iso`) are fetched into an out-of-tree cache by
`build/sources/fetch.sh` and consumed by the build; they are pinned by hash in
`build/sources/pins.lock` (the TL 2023 pins remain recorded there until
retired). One narrow exception: the retired patch records under
`build/patches/*/HEADER.md` quote small excerpts of the patched third-party
sources (libpng and zlib, both permissively licensed — the defects were fixed
upstream in TL 2026 and the patches retired) under those sources' own licenses.

## Build dependencies

Build dependencies are **pinned by hash in `build/sources/pins.lock`**, which is
the authoritative inventory of every external input the reproducible build
fetches. These sources are downloaded into an out-of-tree cache and compiled by
the build; they are **not vendored into this repository**. Their license
identifiers are recorded in the table below and pinned in
`build/sources/pins.lock`; the full per-package license text carried alongside
the release artifacts is assembled at the release-engineering license audit
(DESIGN.md §7, §9).

| Source (`pins.lock` id) | Pin | License (confirmed against `pins.lock` at the item-7 audit) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `texlive-source-2026` | `texlive-2026.0` tarball | TeX Live source tree — mixed (Knuth / LPPL / GPL / …) |
| `expat` | `expat-2.5.0.tar.gz` | MIT |
| `fontconfig` | `fontconfig-2.13.96.tar.gz` | MIT-style (fontconfig) |
| `texlive-iso-2026` | `texlive2026-20260301.iso` | TeX Live aggregate (per-package) |

`expat` and `fontconfig` are the only libraries the busytex Makefile fetches
outside the TeX Live source tree; TeX Live vendors its other normal dependencies
(among others: harfbuzz, icu, freetype, zlib, graphite2, teckit, pplib, zziplib,
libpaper, lua53, xpdf), which are therefore covered by the `texlive-source` pin. The
toolchain container (`ubuntu:22.04`, emsdk/Emscripten 3.1.43) is recorded in
`pins.lock` (`[toolchain-image-arm64]`, the canonical arm64 builder;
`[toolchain-image]`, the parked amd64 equivalence lane) and `build/toolchain/`;
the same pinned emsdk is consumed by both containers and the native host path
(`build/toolchain/native-host.md`), differing only in platform binaries
(linux-arm64 / linux-amd64 / darwin-arm64 respectively). GNU tools installed via
Homebrew for the native path are host prerequisites only and never enter the
artifact provenance chain.

## Development and test tooling (not distributed)

The `demo/` package is an M0 CI smoke vehicle — not the runtime npm package and
not part of any release artifact. Its sole dependency, the dev-only
`@playwright/test` (Apache-2.0, `demo/package.json` `devDependencies`), drives
the headless-browser hello-world PDF smoke; it is not vendored, is absent from
`runtime/`, and ships in nothing WasmTeX distributes, so it carries no
third-party-notice obligation. It is recorded here only so its omission from the
inventory above is a stated posture rather than a gap.

The `runtime/` package's own `devDependencies` — `typescript` and `vitest`
(both MIT/Apache-family dev tooling) and, from M1 item 5, **`esbuild`**
(MIT, `runtime/package.json` `devDependencies`, pinned exact) — are build/test
tools, not distributed. `esbuild` bundles `runtime/worker/entry.ts` into the
single self-contained classic-worker script `runtime/dist/worker.js`
(`npm run build:worker`); it injects no runtime of its own, so that output is
100% WasmTeX-authored MIT code and the tool itself ships in nothing WasmTeX
distributes. Like the engine build toolchain, these carry no third-party-notice
obligation and are recorded here only as a stated posture.

## Conformance test fixtures (not distributed)

Two verbatim third-party LaTeX document classes are vendored under
`conformance/corpus/` as **test input only** (DESIGN.md §2 clause 2 — TeX Live
upstream files under their own licenses, inventoried here). They exercise the
runtime's ability to typeset against a caller-supplied journal class that
WasmTeX does not bundle. They are **not** part of any shipped bundle, the
published npm package, or the release asset archives, and the license/provenance
audit's SPDX-header scan does not cover them (they must stay byte-verbatim).

Both are copied byte-for-byte from the pinned TeX Live 2026 source archive and
kept verbatim (LPPL permits modified redistribution only under rename/notice
conditions, so an unmodified copy is the clean path and avoids those obligations). The accompanying `paper.tex` in each directory is
original WasmTeX work (MIT), written from scratch — it is **not** derived from
any IEEE- or Elsevier-supplied template or sample document. Shipping journal
document classes as a first-class, supported feature is deferred to a future
milestone and will be delivered as a **separate on-demand package/tier**, never
folded into the `academic` bundle.
